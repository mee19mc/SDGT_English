# WIP Unofficial SDGT English Translation

Currently a Work In Progress
This repository contains **JSON translation data** extracted with FModel.  
All files here represent **text-only content** (no binaries, models, or other assets).  
The goal of this project is to make the game accessible to English-speaking players through a community-driven translation patch.
All translated JSON will be published here as I get around to it.

## 📘 Project Overview
- **Purpose:** Provide English translations of in-game text for educational, preservation, and accessibility purposes.  
- **No Assets:** This repository does **not** contain original game data, media, or proprietary files.

## ⚙️ Usage
1. Obtain a legitimate copy of the original game.  
2. Use Unreal Engine modding tools to repack the translated `.json` data into a `.pak` file.  
3. Place the translated `.pak` into your game’s `Paks` directory.  
4. Launch the game to view the English translation in effect.
